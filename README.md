TeaMe is a program with emotional intelligence at its core. Based on The Junto Institute for Entrepreneurial Leadership’s emotion wheel, TeaMe aims to help users better identify the root of their emotions and inversely, expand their understanding and articulation of such. The user will receive a quote, and a tea suggestion that reflects their input with additional ingredients and benefits. This program is great for groups, partners, or individuals to foster healthier open honest discussions about their current mood over a cup of tea that reflects said mood. It’s ‘steep’ dive into your mind![image](https://github.com/CynCity098/TeaMe-CIT244/assets/135188589/e4924722-e14b-4a14-964f-3ff3acc317dd)

This project was completed in 8 days using JavaFx for a level 3 Java course taught by James Winyard @ the Community College of Allegheny County. I was forced to borrow a school System as JavaFX was having issues installing on my home system. I hope to one day round out this project on my own system by adding sound effects, an opening page, background music, and fixing some of the initial bugs.

To run the program, run from "mainStage.java"
